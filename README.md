# Configurable Tic Tac Toe Game
## Project Description
This project was started with the intention to choose a beginner level project that could be easily extended with further functionality. The aim of this project is to create a Tic Tac Toe-like game which can be where the grid size and winning conditions can be modified. The game can be scaled from a simple 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game to a 15x15 Gomoku (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) game where you will need to connect 5 in a row to win. 

The initial objectives of this project is to:
- Develop all the logic for this game and create a back-end API using Python Flask.
- Connect it with a web based frontend developed using React.js with a user interface that displays the game and some basic functionality like a restart button.
- The front-end will only handle the UI components and communicate with the backend using HTTP requests which will process the game logic.
- Deploy the game on a cloud host to learn more about deployment.

## Project Goals
My goals for this project are the following:
- Develop and test my coding skills with Python.
- Write organized, reusable and readable code so that additional functionality can be implemented easily.
- Improve my knowledge of frontend and backend integration and API development.

## About the Project
- Author: David Tran
- Status: In development
