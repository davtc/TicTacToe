# TicTacToe
This project was started as a beginner level project to develop and test my coding skills with Python. The intention of this project is to create a Tic Tac Toe-like game 
with the ability to modify it by changing settings like the grid size, player symbol and winning conditions. The game will be coded in Pything and also be connected to 
a web based front-end as the user interface.
